## Technical Implementation

### Parser Logic
The ProjectModal component automatically:
- Splits by `\n\n` for sections
- Detects headings (lines ending with `:`)
- Formats bullet points (lines starting with `•`)
- Highlights text in parentheses `()`
- Applies proper styling to each element

### No Manual Work Required
All existing project data automatically displays in the new format!
