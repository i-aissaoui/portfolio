## PROFILE

Highly motivated final-year AI and Data Science student (Ingénieur d'État) with a unique combination of deep AI knowledge and practical, end-to-end software engineering skills. Possesses a strong command of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP, demonstrated by building foundational transformer models (like BERT, GPT, and RAG) from the ground up.

Skilled in applying this core AI expertise to build and deploy robust applications, utilizing advanced full-stack web (React, Next.js, FastAPI), desktop (PyQt), and database (SQL/NoSQL) technologies. Eager to secure a challenging role as an AI Engineer or Full-Stack ML Engineer where I can contribute both my model development and software architecture skills.
